    text: `Hi Alex,

Thanks for reaching out about this issue.
I understand that this is urgent, so I will do my best to help get your production environment back up and running as quickly as possible!

You mentioned your production site is returning a 500 error on every page, while preview deployments work fine. This often points to a difference between the production and preview environments. In many cases, it's because the live production site is missing some settings (like API URLs or login keys) that tell it where to get its data.

Since this is one of the most common issues, let's start here by checking your production environment variables: 

1. In your Vercel Dashboard, open your project.
2. Go to Settings -> Environment Variables.
3. In the Environments dropdown, switch from Preview and Development to Production.

If the variables and values are not the same in both environments, add the missing variable names and corresponding values to Production, then redeploy the site.

Once you've tried this, let me know if it resolves the error.
If the issue persists, our next step would be checking the function logs for your latest production deployment in the Vercel Dashboard which we can use to troubleshoot further.

Best regards,
Gavin Walsh
